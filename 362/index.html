				<p><a href="https://www.warwicksu.com/thedirtyduck/home/">The Dirty Duck</a> is on the first floor of the Students' Union building at Warwick University. Please meet where the run will start in the plaza by the side of the Students' Union â€“ Costa Coffee is clearly visible on the ground floor on the far side of the plaza from the road. The Students' Union is across the road from the Arts Centre which is currently undergoing major building works.</p>
				<p>Parking is available in the multi-storey <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/9C4W9CJR%2BW8" title="Google Map">Car Park 8</a>. It is free from 6pm onwards. Directions to the carpark from the A46 are as follows:</p>

					<li>Enter the University area going straight on at the roundabout with the bus stands and closed off new entrance on your right</li>
					<li>Continue straight on through the 20mph zone</li>
					<li>At the next roundabout go right into the University main campus</li>
					<li>Follow the main street round a right hand bend, carry on along the straight, under a glass bridge linking two buildings</li>
					<li>shortly after you will see the multi-storey car park on your left</li>
					<li>Turn left immediately into the side street where the car park entrance is located</li>

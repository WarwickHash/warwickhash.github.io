				<h2>Social Distancing Exercise</h2>
				<p>You should be redirected to the &#8220;group of six&#8221; spreadsheet shortly.</p>
				<p>Or, you can click the following link: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PpGBQeCnB6oATZfokbyJYiuNeHcrEUsBDDVHYD3DMI8" title="Google Sheet">Spreadsheet</a></p>
				<p>As a reminder, we will be exercising in line with the following &#8220;rules&#8221; to minimise risk of exposure for all:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>All attendees must travel individually, or with members of their household</li>
					<li>On arrival, please maintain a greater than 2-metre gap between yourself and any others</li>
					<li>Depending on numbers, we will split attendees into groups of six people</li>
					<li>Each group will have a nominated &#8220;trail lead&#8221;, responsible for setting the route (no flour marks for now)</li>
					<li>Groups will go in separate directions, or ensure that there is a good gap between each other</li>
					<li>Groups should endeavour to remain separate at the end of the trail</li>
					<li>Attendees should bring their own drink(s) to consume at the end of the trail</li>
					<li>Attendees should bring/use their own individual hand sanitiser, if they wish to</li>
					<li>There should be no sharing of drink containers</li>
					<li>There will be no &#8220;hash fees&#8221; collected, for now</li>
					<li>It is recommended that attendees go straight home after the event</li>
				</ul>
				<p>It is assumed that by attending you have read, agreed, and are willing to abide by these guidelines for the health of all involved.</p>

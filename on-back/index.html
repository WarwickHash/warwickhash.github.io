				<h2>Managed Return to Hashing</h2>
				<p>As of August 1<sup>st</sup>, we will return to &#8220;hashing&#8221; with care...</p>
				<ul>
					<li>All attendees must travel individually, or with members of their household</li>
					<li>On arrival, please maintain a greater than 2-metre gap between yourself and any others</li>
					<li>Depending on numbers, we will split attendees into groups of six people</li>
					<li>Groups of six will head out from the start location at one minute intervals</li>
					<li>A trail will be laid, and the first group may kick-out the trail (or leave this for the hare who will be in the final group)</li>
					<li>Groups should endeavour to remain separate at the end of the trail</li>
					<li>Individuals may purchase drinks from the pub, following any guidance that the establishment has in place</li>
					<li>Attendees should bring/use their own individual hand sanitiser, if they wish to</li>
					<li>There should be no sharing of drink containers</li>
					<li>Hash fees will be collected and used to subsidise down-downs for the circle</li>
					<li>It is recommended that attendees go straight home after the event</li>
				</ul>
				<p>It is assumed that by attending you have read, agreed, and are willing to abide by these guidelines for the health of all involved.</p>
